Libzeep webapp starter
======================

This is a project containing a very simple web application based on libzeep.
It is meant to get new projects up and running fast.

To build this you will need to have [libzeep](https://github.com/mhekkel/libzeep) installed as well
as [libmcfp](https://github.com/mhekkel/libmcfp.git). You will also need _cmake_ but since you have
libzeep that should not be a problem. [mrc](https://github.com/mhekkel/mrc.git) should also be 
installed if your platform supports it. And you need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
